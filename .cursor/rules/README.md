## Rules Overview

### 1. [project-structure.mdc](project-structure.mdc)
**Always Applied** - Provides an overview of the project structure, key files, and architecture. Essential for understanding the codebase organization.

### 2. [react-native-coding-standards.mdc](react-native-coding-standards.mdc)
**Applied to TypeScript/JavaScript files** - Defines coding standards, component structure, TypeScript guidelines, and React Native best practices.

### 3. [ios-swiftui-integration.mdc](ios-swiftui-integration.mdc)
**Applied to iOS-specific files** - Guidelines for integrating SwiftUI with React Native, native module development, and iOS-specific features.

### 4. [expo-development.mdc](expo-development.mdc)
**Applied to Expo configuration files** - Expo-specific development guidelines, configuration management, and platform-specific features.

### 5. [component-architecture.mdc](component-architecture.mdc)
**Applied to component files** - Component organization, design patterns, theming, and architecture guidelines.

### 6. [development-workflow.mdc](development-workflow.mdc)
**Always Applied** - Development workflow, task management, testing strategies, and deployment processes.

## Usage

These rules are automatically applied by Cursor based on:
- **alwaysApply**: Rules that apply to every request
- **globs**: File pattern matching for specific file types
- **description**: Manual application based on description matching

## Key Features

- **Multi-platform Support**: Guidelines for Android, iOS, and Web development
- **SwiftUI Integration**: Specific rules for iOS native development
- **Expo Ecosystem**: Comprehensive Expo development guidelines
- **TypeScript Focus**: Strong typing and code quality standards
- **Component Architecture**: Structured component organization
- **Performance Optimization**: Best practices for React Native performance

## Project Context

This is a React Native application built with:
- Expo SDK 53
- TypeScript for type safety
- Expo Router for navigation
- Support for Android, iOS, and Web platforms
- SwiftUI integration for iOS native features

## Maintenance

- Update rules when project structure changes
- Add new rules for emerging patterns
- Review and refine rules based on team feedback
- Keep rules aligned with current best practices
