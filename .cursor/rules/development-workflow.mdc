# Development Workflow

## Task Management
- Always create a to-do list for new tasks
- Break down complex tasks into smaller steps
- Check off completed tasks as you go
- Follow a step-by-step approach for implementation

## Development Environment Setup
- Use Node.js and npm for package management
- Install Expo CLI globally: `npm install -g @expo/cli`
- Use TypeScript for all new development
- Configure ESLint for code quality

## Development Commands
Reference [package.json](mdc:package.json) for available scripts:
- `npm start` - Start Expo development server
- `npm run android` - Start Android development
- `npm run ios` - Start iOS development
- `npm run web` - Start web development
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality

## Code Quality Standards
- Follow ESLint configuration in [eslint.config.js](mdc:eslint.config.js)
- Use TypeScript strict mode as configured in [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json)
- Implement proper error handling
- Write meaningful commit messages

## Testing Strategy
- Test on all target platforms (iOS, Android, Web)
- Use iOS Simulator for iOS testing
- Use Android Emulator for Android testing
- Test on physical devices for final validation
- Implement unit tests for critical components

## Version Control
- Use Git for version control
- Follow conventional commit messages
- Create feature branches for new development
- Review code before merging
- Keep commits atomic and focused

## Platform-Specific Development
- Test iOS-specific features on iOS Simulator
- Test Android-specific features on Android Emulator
- Use platform-specific file extensions when needed
- Implement proper platform detection

## Performance Monitoring
- Monitor app performance on all platforms
- Use React DevTools for debugging
- Profile memory usage
- Optimize bundle size
- Monitor network requests

## Deployment Process
- Use EAS Build for production builds
- Test builds on all target platforms
- Implement proper environment management
- Follow app store guidelines
- Monitor crash reports and analytics
